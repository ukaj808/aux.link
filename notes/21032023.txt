2. Refactor from queue to Priority Heap
  a. Use heap lib [X]
  b. Rewrite code to use heap as SongQueue [X]
  c. Read Chapter 3 in okasakis PFDS []
  d. Complete heap excercises []

3. Create a User m mobit. I think I could create a mvar for every user in the room
   so I can seperate out concurrency logic for room-level modifications and user-level modifications.
   I don't think a users modification of there own song queue should hold up the lock for the whole room.
   This seems like it'll be a pretty common occurence; amongst other possible user level modifcations; that
   shouldnt need to be mixed up with room mvar locking. []
